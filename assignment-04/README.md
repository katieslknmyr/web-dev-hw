# Assignment 04
## Katie Schlichenmayer

The snapshot I chose to go to was Yahoo.com. It showed me what it looked like in 1996 when it first started. It looks nothing like it does now or what it looked like when I was younger. There are no pictures and it is really just a page with a bunch of links you can click on depending on what you want to read. 

The GIT module was very confusing at first and it took me a lot of errors to make sure I was doing the assignments correct. It is still challenging for me to use the module because I have never done anything like this before.
