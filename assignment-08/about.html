    <h3>Why I choose this project</h3>
    <b>I choose to show how to make slime because when thinking about what to do for this assignment I thought about my sister. When my sister was younger, she used to make slime all of the time. She had so many different ingredients to make slime and I always thought it was such a strange hobby to have. Slime is super simple to make, I am personally not a fan of the way slime feels but I find that a lot of kids love to make and play with it. If you would like to learn more about how to make slime, you can google it and find other methods.</b>
