# Assignment 08
## Katie Schlichenmayer

HTML is still very confusing to me. Since I have never done anything related to this criteria before, it is challenging but I am slowly but surely getting the hang of it. Something new that I liked doing was being able to change the background of the webpage to different colors.

I am excited for the next module but also nervous and hope that I don't get too confused while doing the assignment.

In this assignment, I learned how to add more to me webpage and make it more detailed with adding extra buttons and links you can go to from one webpage.
