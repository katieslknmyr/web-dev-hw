Span and div are both generic HTML elements that group together related parts of a web page. But they both sere different functions. A div element is used for block-level organization and styling of page elements while a span element is used for inline organization and styling.

Alt text is the written copy that appears in place of an image on a webpage if the image fails to load on a user's screen. This text helps screen-reading tools describe images to visually impaired readers and allows search engines to better rank your website.
