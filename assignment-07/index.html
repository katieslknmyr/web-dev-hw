      <h1>Lyrics</h1>
      <p>
                DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DE-DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DAA-DAAAAA
        DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DE-DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DAA-DAA-DAA-DAA-DAAAA!
        Well, I walk into the room
        Passing out hundred dollar bills
        And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill
        And I buy the bar a double round of crown
        And everybody's getting down
        An' this town ain't never gonna be the same.
        Cause I saddle up my horse
        And I ride into the city
        I make a lot of noise
        Cause the girls
        They are so pretty
        Riding up and down Broadway
        On my old stud Leroy
        And the girls say
        Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
        Everybody says
        Save a horse, Ride a cowboy
        Well I don't give a dang about nothing
        I'm singing and Bling- Blanging
        While the girls are drinking
        Long necks down!
        And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy
        Or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
        Or your freak parade
        I'm the only John Wayne left in this town
        And I saddle up my horse
        And I ride into the city
        I make a lot of noise
        Cause the girls
        They are so pretty
        Riding up and down Broadway
        On my old stud Leroy
        And the girls say
        Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
        Everybody says
        Save a horse, Ride a cowboy
        I'm a thourough-bred
        That's what she said
        In the back of my truck bed
        As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
        Out on some back country road.
        We where flying high
        Fine as wine, having ourselves a big and rich time
        And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go.
        But her evaluation
        Of my cowboy reputation
        Had me begging for salvation
        All night long
        So I took her out giggin frogs
        Introduced her to my old bird dog
        And sang her every Willie Nelson song I could think of
        And we made love
        And I saddled up my horse
        And I ride into the city
        I make a lot of noise
        Cause the girls
        They are so pretty
        Riding up and down Broadway
        On my old stud Leroy
        And the girls say
        Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
        Everybody says
        Save a horse, Ride a cowboy
        What? What?
        Save A Horse Ride A Cowboy
        Everybody says
        Save a Horse Ride a cowboy.
