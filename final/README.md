# Final
## Katie Schlichenmayer

I learned a lot of new things that I never knew before. Web design is a lot harder than I thought it could ever be. I never realized how much went behind putting together a website. It was interesting to learn all of the codes and what they do. The tricky part for me was making sure that I typed everything in correctly. Overall, I learned so much about web design. I never would have thought that I would know how to add media or change color and fonts.

For this assignment, I put together everything I learned throughout this course and make it into one site. It is hard for me to come up with new ideas so I took some that I had previously used in some assignments but switched some of the things up.
