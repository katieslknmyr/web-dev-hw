I have come across different types of forms while on the internet. Most of the forms are just filling in blank spots for a survey.

Text, selection, and button inputs can be used for surveys as well. They come in handy and make taking surveys a lot more simple.

This assignment didn't seem too difficult. I learned how to make forms which was very interesting.
