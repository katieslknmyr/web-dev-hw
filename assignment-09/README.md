A type selector is sometimes referred to as a tag name selector or element selector because it selects HTML tag/element in your document. Universal selectors are indicated by an asterisk. It selects everything in the document. Class selectors start with a dot character and will select everything in the document with that class applied to it. Lastly, ID selectors begin with a # rather than a dot character. They are used in the same way a class selector, however an ID can be used only once per page.
