A type selector is sometimes referred to as a tag name selector or element selector because it selects HTML tag/element in your document. Universal selectors are indicated by an asterisk. It selects everything in the document. Class selectors start with a dot character and will select everything in the document with that class applied to it. Lastly, ID selectors begin with a # rather than a dot character. They are used in the same way a class selector, however an ID can be used only once per page.

I choose to go with a 1960s color palette. The reason why I chose this palette is because this is the decade that my dad was born in. I also do like the colors as well. It was interesting reading about what trends were popular during this time, because they are making a comeback now.

I really liked this assignment, because it was cool to learn how to add different colors into the page. It was confusing figuring out the codes for the colors because some of the codes I found were not working.
