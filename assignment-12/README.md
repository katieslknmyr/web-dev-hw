# Assignment 12
## Katie Schlichenmayer

My imaginary client is someone who is starting their own business making clay earrings. They wanted their site to be simple with color tones that weren't very bright. I set up the basic part of their website and left space for information that they want to include.

The major difference is that display: incline-block allows to set a width and height on the element. Also with display: incline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: incline they are not.

In this assignment we learned how to add more tabs to our site and we mainly put everything we learned in past assignments into this one. I kind of struggled with this one and hope I did it right.
